To launch project:

clone project (I hope you can do that)

```cd [folder of your project]```

```docker compose up```


(I hope you have docker installed globally. If it's not - install docker via your favorite npm or yarn)

After that in separate terminal run 

```npm i```

(or ```yarn```)

and after installing dependencies is over:

```npm run test```

(or ```yarn test```)

Tests will successfully pass.

Good luck!
